# Instagram OAuth Flow Improvements

## UX Improvements

We've made several improvements to the Instagram OAuth authentication flow to provide a better user experience:

1. **Clear Authentication Feedback**:
   - The OAuth callback page now shows detailed status information with clear visual feedback
   - Users can see which Instagram accounts have been successfully connected
   - Success and error states are clearly communicated with appropriate icons and messages

2. **Automatic Parent Window Updates**:
   - The OAuth callback window sends a message to the parent window when authentication is successful
   - The parent window listens for these messages and updates its state accordingly
   - No need for manual page refresh (F5) after authentication

3. **Automatic Window Management**:
   - The callback page automatically closes after a countdown (5 seconds)
   - Users can also manually close the window with the "Close now" button
   - The parent window is automatically refreshed to show updated authentication state

4. **Reliable Connection Status**:
   - Added `checkInstagramConnection()` method to AuthContext to verify connection status
   - Connection status is stored in localStorage and verified with the API
   - SearchPage now re-checks connection status before proceeding to post configuration

## Technical Implementation

The flow now works as follows:

1. User initiates Instagram connection from the InstagramLoginModal
2. A popup opens with the Instagram authorization page
3. After authentication, Instagram redirects to our callback page
4. The callback page:
   - Processes the authentication code
   - Shows success/error feedback
   - Sends a message to the parent window
   - Automatically closes after countdown
5. The parent window:
   - Receives the message
   - Updates the connection status
   - Refreshes UI components that depend on authentication
   - Allows the user to proceed to posting

## Benefits

- Clearer user feedback during authentication
- Eliminated the need for manual page refresh
- More reliable connection state management
- Better error handling and user guidance
- Improved overall user experience

## Troubleshooting

- Browser popup blockers may interfere with the window opening
- Cross-origin communication requires same-origin for security
- Message passing requires both sender and receiver to be properly configured
